# Crusader’s Journey in the World of Images
## Blog Series
***
by : JP Fabrero

Candidly, this series of blogs is composed by someone who had little to no care for images, poorly maintained Instagram profile, and someone who loathes writing. Anything you read may not of quality but I do hope the codes may help you in your own journey. Over the duration of my term here in the MS Data Science program, I’ve to come to appreciate how data comes in all forms - structured and unstructured. Images, an example of unstructured data, unbelievably hold ridiculous amount of information waiting to be inferred. In the name of Data Science, these writings, albeit a course requirement, aim to record my efforts to uncover and learn the ‘hidden’ secrets of processing and mining the treasure troves abundantly present in our generations.
